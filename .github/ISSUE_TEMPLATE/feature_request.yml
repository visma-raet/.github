      **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for visma-raet!**



      üí°
      Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it
      would be useful for majority of the users. As a general rule of
      thumb, any feature that is only of interest to a small sub group
      should be implemented separately or maybe even just your project
      alone.

      </details>


      ‚ö†
      Verify first that your idea is not [already requested on
      GitHub][issue search].

      Also test if the devel branch does not already implement this.

      Describe the new feature/improvement you would like briefly below.


      What's the problem this feature will solve?

      What are you trying to do, that you are unable to achieve
      with the current project as it currently stands?


      * Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable
      and how it solves the problem you described.

      * How do you solve this now?

      * Have you tried to work around the problem using other tools?

      * Could there be a different approach to solving this issue?

      I am trying to do X with this project from the devel branch on GitHub and
      I think that implementing a feature Y would be very helpful for me and
      every other user of this project because of Z.

        We would do it by ourselves but unfortunatelly, the curent
        edition of GitHub Issue Forms Alpha does not support this yet ü§∑


        _We will make it easier in the future, once GitHub
        supports dropdown defaults. Promise!_
